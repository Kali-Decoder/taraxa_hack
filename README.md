## Future
- The users and companies will stake Taraxa tokens as a collateral to get FI tokens which they will use to report bugs and resolve bugs.
- The bugs reported by the users if accepted by the company, then the bug report will get generated into NFT's which will have a timestamp that will help to prove if two or more users have reported the bugs at same time and the model will trigger function to reward the early submitter.
- The reported bugs if accepted by companies then a function triggers that will automatically generate a AI NFT to the user which will increase the credibility of the bug reporter in the leaderboard and provide a booster multiplier to receive more Tokens.
- This NFT can also be utilized as a swap for the Taraxa Token Airdrop or FI Tokens for contributing actively in the Taraxa ecosystem.
- The model can easily adapt the layer.xyz / zealy kind of model functionality for the Taraxa ecosystem.
- Launch on Taraxa Mainnet
